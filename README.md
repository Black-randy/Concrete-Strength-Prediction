# Concrete Strength Prediction Script

## Overview

This Python script performs concrete strength prediction using machine learning models. It covers various steps, including data preprocessing, visualization, outlier handling, model training, and evaluation.

## Steps

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- Downloads and organizes data from GitHub.
- Loads data into Pandas DataFrames.
- Displays information about the data (shape, data types, missing values, descriptive statistics).

### 2. Visualization

- Visualizes feature importances using a Random Forest Regressor.
- Creates pair plots for all columns (commented out).
- Visualizes outliers using box plots and histograms for each feature.

### 3. Outlier Handling

- Identifies and visualizes outliers for each feature.
- Fixes outliers by replacing values outside the lower and upper bounds with the median of the column.

### 4. Model Training and Evaluation

- Splits the data into training, validation, and test sets.
- Trains various regression models: Linear Regression, Multilinear Regression, and Random Forest Regressor.
- Evaluates the models using scores, RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), and R-squared.

### 5. Additional Steps

- Performs KMeans clustering to find the optimal number of clusters.
- Visualizes the correlation matrix.
- Uses RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning of the Random Forest Regressor.

### 6. Results and Visualization

- Displays various metrics such as scores, coefficients, and model performance.

## Conclusion

The script provides a comprehensive analysis of concrete strength prediction, including data exploration, feature visualization, outlier handling, and model training. The results and insights gained from this script can be used to inform further analysis or improvements in concrete strength prediction models.
